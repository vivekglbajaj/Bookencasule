Book Class in Java
This Java project implements a Book class that demonstrates encapsulation by allowing controlled access to its attributes (title, author, and price).

Features
✅ Get and set title and author using public methods.
✅ Restricts direct modification of price outside the class.
✅ Provides a controlled method (updatePrice()) to change the price.
✅ Ensures price validation (prevents negative values).
